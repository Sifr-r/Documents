# Fringe Cases

## Warnings & Notes

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

> [!NOTE]
> When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that some years have 53 weeks in them (see [Weeks per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Weeks_per_year))! You'll need to take this into consideration when developing production apps.
