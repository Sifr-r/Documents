# Fringe Cases

## Warnings & Notes

> [!WARNING]
> This method parses its input as HTML, writing the result into the DOM.
> APIs like this are known as [injection sinks](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#concepts_and_usage), and are potentially a vector for [cross-site-scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attacks, if the input originally came from an attacker.

> You can mitigate this risk by always passing `TrustedHTML` objects instead of strings and [enforcing trusted types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types).
> See [Security considerations](#security_considerations) for more information.

## Exceptions

- `InvalidStateError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : The method was called on an XML document, or called when the parser is currently executing a custom element constructor.
- `TypeError`
  - : A string is passed as one of the parameters when [Trusted Types are enforced](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types) and [no default policy has been defined](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TrustedTypePolicyFactory/createPolicy#creating_a_default_policy) for creating {{domxref("TrustedHTML")}} objects.

## Security Notes

The method is a possible vector for [Cross-site-scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attacks, where potentially unsafe strings provided by a user are injected into the DOM without first being sanitized.
While the method may block {{HTMLElement("script")}} elements from executing when they are injected in some browsers (see [Intervening against document.write()](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/removing-document-write/) for Chrome), it is susceptible to many other ways that attackers can craft HTML to run malicious JavaScript.

You can mitigate these issues by always passing {{domxref("TrustedHTML")}} objects instead of strings, and [enforcing trusted types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types) using the [`require-trusted-types-for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for) CSP directive.
This ensures that the input is passed through a transformation function, which has the chance to [sanitize](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS#sanitization) the input to remove potentially dangerous markup (such as {{htmlelement("script")}} elements and event handler attributes), before it is injected.
