## Security Notes

The `href.baseVal` property is used to load and run external scripts.
If the SVG is declared inline, the fetched script is run in the context of the current page, and can hence do anything that your own website code can do (even if the URL is not same-origin with your site).
If the input is provided by a user, this is a possible vector for [cross-site scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attacks.

It is extremely risky to accept and execute arbitrary URLs from untrusted origins.
A website should control what scripts that are allowed to run using a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) with the [`script-src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) directive (or a fallback defined in [`default-src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/default-src)).
This can restrict scripts to those from the current origin, or a specific set of origins, or even particular files.

If you're using this property and [enforcing trusted types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types) (using the [`require-trusted-types-for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for) CSP directive), you will need to always assign {{domxref("TrustedScriptURL")}} objects instead of strings.
This ensures that the input is passed through a transformation function, which has the chance to reject or modify the URL before the resource is fetched.
