# Fringe Cases

## Warnings & Notes

> [!WARNING]
> This property parses its input as HTML, writing the result into the DOM.
> APIs like this are known as [injection sinks](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#concepts_and_usage), and are potentially a vector for [cross-site scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attacks, if the input originally came from an attacker.

> You can mitigate this risk by always assigning `TrustedHTML` objects instead of strings and [enforcing trusted types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types).
> See [Security considerations](#security_considerations) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> {{domxref("Node.textContent")}} should be used when you know that the user provided content should be plain text.
> This prevents it being parsed as HTML.

> [!WARNING]
> While you can directly assign a string to `innerHTML` this is a [security risk](#security_considerations) if the string to be inserted might contain potentially malicious content.
> You should use `TrustedHTML` to ensure that the content is sanitized before it is inserted, and you should set a CSP header to [enforce trusted types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types).

## Exceptions

- `SyntaxError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if an attempt was made to set the value of `innerHTML` using a string which is not properly-formed HTML.
- `TypeError`
  - : Thrown if the property is set to a string when [Trusted Types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API) are [enforced by a CSP](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types) and no default policy is defined.
- `NoModificationAllowedError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if an attempt was made to insert the HTML into a node whose parent is a {{domxref("Document")}}.

## Security Notes

The `innerHTML` property is probably the most common vector for [cross-site scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attacks, where potentially unsafe strings provided by a user are injected into the DOM without first being sanitized.
While the property does prevent {{HTMLElement("script")}} elements from executing when they are injected, it is susceptible to many other ways that attackers can craft HTML to run malicious JavaScript.
For example, the following example would execute the code in the `error` event handler, because the {{htmlelement("img")}} `src` value is not a valid image URL:

```js
const name = "<img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>";
el.innerHTML = name; // shows the alert
```

You can mitigate these issues by always assigning {{domxref("TrustedHTML")}} objects instead of strings, and [enforcing trusted types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#using_a_csp_to_enforce_trusted_types) using the [`require-trusted-types-for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for) CSP directive.
This ensures that the input is passed through a transformation function, which has the chance to [sanitize](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS#sanitization) the input to remove potentially dangerous markup before it is injected.
