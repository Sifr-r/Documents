# Fringe Cases

## Warnings & Notes

> [!NOTE]
> Since the global scope of the worker script is effectively the global scope of the worker you are running ({{domxref("DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope")}} or whatever) and all worker global scopes inherit methods, properties, etc. from `WorkerGlobalScope`, you can run lines such as those above without specifying a parent object.
