# Fringe Cases

## Exceptions

- {{jsxref("TypeError")}}
  - : Thrown in one of the following cases:
    - `info` is not an object or a string.
    - `options` is not an object or `undefined`.
    - The provided properties are insufficient to unambiguously determine a date. You usually need to provide a `year` (or `era` and `eraYear`), a `month` (or `monthCode`), and a `day`.
- {{jsxref("RangeError")}}
  - : Thrown in one of the following cases:
    - The provided properties that specify the same component are inconsistent.
    - The provided non-numerical properties are not valid; for example, if `monthCode` is never a valid month code in this calendar.
    - The provided numerical properties are out of range, and `options.overflow` is set to `"reject"`.
    - The wall-clock time is ambiguous in the time zone, and `options.disambiguation` is set to `"reject"`.
    - The info is not in the [representable range](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal#representable_dates), which is ±10<sup>8</sup> days, or about ±273,972.6 years, from the Unix epoch.
