# Fringe Cases

## Warnings & Notes

> [!NOTE]
> `Temporal.Duration()` can only be constructed with [`new`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new). Attempting to call it without `new` throws a {{jsxref("TypeError")}}.

## Exceptions

- {{jsxref("RangeError")}}
  - : Thrown in one of the following cases:
    - Any of the parameters is not an integer (including non-finite values).
    - A [calendar unit](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/Duration#calendar_durations) (years, months, weeks) has an absolute value ≥ 2<sup>32</sup>.
    - The non-calendar part of the duration (days and below), when expressed in seconds, has an absolute value ≥ 2<sup>53</sup>.
