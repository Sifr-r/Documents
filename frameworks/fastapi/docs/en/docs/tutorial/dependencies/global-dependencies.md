# global-dependencies

## Introduction

For some types of applications you might want to add dependencies to the whole application.

Similar to the way you can [add `dependencies` to the *path operation decorators*](dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md), you can add them to the `FastAPI` application.

In that case, they will be applied to all the *path operations* in the application:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial012_an_py310.py hl[17] *}

And all the ideas in the section about [adding `dependencies` to the *path operation decorators*](dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md) still apply, but in this case, to all of the *path operations* in the app.
