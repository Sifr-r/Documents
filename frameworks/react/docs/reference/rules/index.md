# Rules of React

## Introduction

Just as different programming languages have their own ways of expressing concepts, React has its own idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications.

To learn more about expressing UIs with React, we recommend reading [Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react).

This section describes the rules you need to follow to write idiomatic React code. Writing idiomatic React code can help you write well organized, safe, and composable applications. These properties make your app more resilient to changes and makes it easier to work with other developers, libraries, and tools.

These rules are known as the **Rules of React**. They are rules – and not just guidelines – in the sense that if they are broken, your app likely has bugs. Your code also becomes unidiomatic and harder to understand and reason about.

We strongly recommend using [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) alongside React's [ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) to help your codebase follow the Rules of React. By following the Rules of React, you'll be able to find and address these bugs and keep your application maintainable.

## Rules of Hooks {//}

Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called. You need to follow the [Rules of Hooks](/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) when using them.

* [Only call Hooks at the top level](/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks#only-call-hooks-at-the-top-level) – Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.
* [Only call Hooks from React functions](/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks#only-call-hooks-from-react-functions) – Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
